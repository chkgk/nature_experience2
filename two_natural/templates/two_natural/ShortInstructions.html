            Remember: Your payoff is jointly determined by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>whether a red or a green ball is drawn from an urn containing 20 red and 80 green balls,</li>
            <li>whether your action is A or B, and</li>
            <li>whether your co-player's action is A or B.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The co-playersâ€™ action is programmed to be <b>A</b> in about 60 out of 100 cases and <b>B</b> in about 40 out of 100 cases.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a green ball is drawn, and:
        <ul>
            <li>your action is A, and your co-player chooses A: You receive US$ 1. The passive participant you are matched with receives US$ 1.</li>
            <li>your action is A, and your co-player chooses B: You receive US$ 1. The passive participant you are matched with receives US$ 3.</li>
            <li>your action is B, and your co-player chooses A: You receive US$ 3. The passive participant you are matched with receives US$ 1.</li>
            <li>your action is B, and your co-player chooses B: You receive nothing (US$ 0). The passive participant you are matched with receives nothing (US$ 0).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
